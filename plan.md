# AI-Powered Real Estate Lead Conversion Platform

## Problem Analysis & Purpose

This platform aims to revolutionize real estate lead conversion by integrating AI-powered communication across multiple channels. The system will synchronize with Go High Level (GHL) for lead management, utilize Vapi.ai for voice interactions, implement Mem0 for persistent memory across conversations, and orchestrate specialized AI agents for different stages of the lead nurturing process. The target users are real estate professionals seeking to automate and enhance their lead conversion process with AI technology.

## Core Features

- **GHL Integration**: Seamless synchronization of leads and activities with Go High Level CRM
- **Multi-Agent Conversation System**: Specialized AI agents for different stages of lead nurturing (initial contact, qualification, nurturing, objection handling, closing, appointment setting)
- **Memory Persistence**: Mem0 integration for maintaining context and lead information across conversations
- **Omnichannel Communication**: Voice calls (Vapi.ai), SMS (SendBlue), and potentially email
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Context-aware responses based on real estate market data and property information
- **Settings Management**: Centralized dashboard for API key configuration and integration settings
- **Standout Feature**: Adaptive Agent Selection - AI-powered analysis of conversation context to automatically select the most appropriate specialized agent for each interaction phase, with seamless transitions between agents that appear natural to the lead

## UI/UX Design

- **Dashboard**: Clean, modern interface with key metrics and recent lead activity
- **Lead Management**: Intuitive list and detail views with conversation history
- **Conversation Interface**: Real-time chat/call interface with agent insights panel
- **Settings Panel**: Well-organized configuration page for all integrations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality on mobile devices for agents on the go

## MVP Implementation Strategy

1. **Setup Project Structure** - Configure FastAPI backend and React frontend with proper routing
2. **Implement Settings Management** - Complete the settings page for API key configuration
3. **Build GHL Integration** - Implement lead synchronization and webhook handling
4. **Develop Memory System** - Integrate Mem0 for persistent memory across conversations
5. **Create Agent Orchestration** - Implement the multi-agent system with specialized roles
6. **Implement Voice Integration** - Connect Vapi.ai for voice communication capabilities
7. **Build Knowledge Base** - Create system for context-aware responses
8. **Develop Dashboard** - Create main interface with key metrics and lead management
9. **Implement Conversation UI** - Build interface for managing communications
10. **Testing & Refinement** - Test all features and refine based on feedback

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The application is structured as a FastAPI backend with a React frontend
- MongoDB will be used for data storage
- The bulk files_writer tool should be used for initial setup and smaller features
- For complex integrations like the agent orchestrator and GHL integration, the str_replace_editor should be used
- GPT-4o will be used for the AI agents to provide state-of-the-art conversational capabilities

## External Dependencies

- **Go High Level API**: Required for lead synchronization
- **Mem0 API**: Required for memory persistence
- **Vapi.ai API**: Required for voice capabilities
- **SendBlue API**: Required for SMS capabilities
- **OpenAI API**: Required for GPT-4o access for the AI agents

## Clarification Required

1. What specific lead data needs to be synchronized from GHL? (e.g., contact info, lead status, notes)
2. Are there specific real estate market data sources that should be integrated into the knowledge base?
3. What metrics are most important for the dashboard?
4. Are there specific compliance requirements for storing conversation data?
5. What is the expected volume of leads and conversations?
