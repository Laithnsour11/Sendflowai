# AI-Powered Real Estate Lead Conversion Platform Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
We need to build an AI-powered omnichannel communication platform specifically for real estate lead conversion. The platform will integrate with Go High Level (GHL) for lead management and leverage cutting-edge AI technologies including multi-agent orchestration, persistent memory with Mem0, and voice capabilities via Vapi.ai. The target users are real estate professionals looking to automate and enhance their lead conversion process.

## Core Features
- **GHL Integration**: Seamless synchronization of leads and contact data
- **Multi-Agent Conversation System**: Orchestrate different AI agents for various conversation scenarios (initial contact, follow-up, qualification, etc.)
- **Persistent Memory**: Store conversation history and lead preferences across interactions using Mem0
- **Voice Communication**: Enable voice-based interactions with leads using Vapi.ai
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Upload and manage real estate-specific content to train AI agents
- **Settings & Configuration**: Manage API keys and system preferences
- **Standout Feature**: "Conversation Playbooks" - Pre-configured multi-agent workflows for different real estate scenarios (luxury properties, first-time buyers, investment properties) with customizable scripts and decision trees

## UI Design
- Modern, clean interface with real estate theming
- Dashboard with lead metrics and conversation analytics
- Conversation interface showing history and agent transitions
- Knowledge base management with document preview
- Settings page with API configuration
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. **Project Setup** (files_writer)
   - Initialize FastAPI backend structure
   - Set up React frontend with Tailwind CSS
   - Configure authentication system

2. **GHL Integration** (str_replace_editor)
   - Create API endpoints for GHL webhook integration
   - Implement lead synchronization logic
   - Build lead management interface

3. **AI Agent System** (str_replace_editor)
   - Implement OpenAI GPT-4o integration
   - Create agent orchestration framework
   - Build conversation management system

4. **Memory Integration** (str_replace_editor)
   - Integrate Mem0 for persistent memory
   - Implement conversation history storage
   - Create memory retrieval system for context

5. **Voice Capabilities** (str_replace_editor)
   - Integrate Vapi.ai for voice interactions
   - Implement voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion
   - Create voice call interface

6. **Knowledge Base** (str_replace_editor)
   - Build document upload and management system
   - Implement knowledge extraction using GPT-4o
   - Create training system for agents

7. **Settings & Configuration** (files_writer)
   - Create API key management interface
   - Implement system preferences
   - Build user profile management

8. **Dashboard & Analytics** (files_writer)
   - Create lead overview dashboard
   - Implement conversation analytics
   - Build performance metrics visualization

## Clarifications Required
1. What specific data fields need to be synchronized from GHL? (contact info, lead status, etc.)
2. Are there specific conversation scenarios that need to be prioritized for the multi-agent system?
3. What types of real estate documents will be used for the knowledge base?
4. Are there any compliance requirements for storing conversation data?
5. What API keys will users need to provide? (OpenAI, Mem0, Vapi.ai, GHL)
6. Is there a preference for how the voice interaction should be triggered? (click-to-call, scheduled calls, etc.)

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: FastAPI for API endpoints and business logic
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, leads, and conversation history
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language processing
- **External Services**: GHL API, Mem0 API, Vapi.ai API
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system

## Development Approach
The development will follow an iterative approach, starting with the core functionality (GHL integration and basic AI conversation) and progressively adding more advanced features. The files_writer tool will be used for initial setup and simpler components, while str_replace_editor will be used for more complex features requiring careful integration.
