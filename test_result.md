The error in the logs shows: 'ValueError: [TypeError(\"'ObjectId' object is not iterable\"), TypeError('vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute')]'. This is likely causing the 'Network Error' in the frontend when clicking 'View Details' in the Conversations component. The issue is related to how MongoDB ObjectId is being handled in the response serialization. The endpoint needs to properly handle ObjectId serialization and return a 404 status code for non-existent leads instead of a 500 error."

The endpoint now correctly handles ObjectId serialization for conversations and interactions, returns proper 404 responses for invalid lead IDs, and includes all expected fields in the response. Tests with valid lead IDs, invalid lead IDs, malformed requests, and missing lead_id all returned the expected responses. The endpoint now properly serializes conversations and interactions, and includes default values for trust_level and conversion_probability fields. This fix should resolve the 'Network Error' in the Conversations component when clicking 'View Details'."

    message: "Tested the simplified implementations of the UI action endpoints. The POST /api/actions/add-lead and POST /api/actions/view-lead endpoints are working correctly. The simplified POST /api/actions/send-message and POST /api/actions/initiate-call endpoints are now working correctly - they successfully create conversation records and return success responses. However, the GET /api/leads endpoint is still failing with a 500 Internal Server Error. Error handling for invalid lead IDs also needs improvement as it's returning 500 errors instead of 404 errors."

    message: "Attempted to test the UI action button functionality in the LeadsList component, but encountered navigation issues. After successful login, when trying to navigate to the Leads page (/leads), the application redirects back to the landing page. This suggests there might be an issue with the routing or authentication for the Leads page. The LeadsList component code looks correct with proper implementation of Message, Call, and View buttons, but we couldn't access the page to test these features. This issue needs to be fixed before we can test the UI action button functionality."

    message: "Successfully tested the UI action button functionality after the authentication persistence fix. Authentication now persists across page refreshes and direct navigation to the Leads page. The Leads page loads correctly with the list of leads. All UI action buttons (Message, Call, View) are working as expected from a frontend perspective. The buttons show proper loading states and user feedback. However, there are backend API issues (422 status codes) when the buttons are clicked. Despite these backend errors, the frontend UI components are working correctly in terms of user interaction and feedback. The backend API issues need to be addressed separately."

    message: "Tested the fixed UI action endpoints with the new Pydantic models and improved error handling. The POST /api/actions/add-lead, POST /api/actions/view-lead, POST /api/actions/send-message, and POST /api/actions/initiate-call endpoints are now working correctly with JSON request bodies. The GET /api/leads endpoint is also working correctly. All endpoints return 200 status codes for valid requests, which means the Pydantic models are working correctly. However, there are still some issues with error handling for invalid lead IDs - they return 500 errors instead of 404 errors. The verification of conversation and interaction records is also not working as expected in some cases. Overall, the critical fix to resolve the 'Error sending message: [object Object]' issue has been successful, as the endpoints now accept JSON request bodies instead of query parameters."

    message: "Successfully tested all API key validation endpoints. All five endpoints (validate-mem0-key, validate-vapi-key, validate-sendblue-key, validate-openai-key, validate-openrouter-key) are working correctly. Each endpoint properly validates API keys with the correct format and rejects invalid keys. All endpoints return a JSON response with a 'valid' boolean and appropriate message. These endpoints should now fix the 'not valid' error in the Settings page."

    message: "Successfully tested the fixed Conversations component. The page loads without any JavaScript errors related to accessing 'overall' on undefined objects. Conversation cards display properly with sentiment indicators showing correctly. The optional chaining and fallbacks for sentiment analysis data are working as expected. We couldn't fully test the 'View Details' modal due to a 500 error from the backend API when clicking the button, but this is not related to the JavaScript error we were testing for. Most importantly, there were no 'Cannot read property 'overall' of undefined' errors in the browser console, confirming that the fixes for optional chaining and fallbacks are working correctly."

    message: "Tested the view-lead endpoint specifically to diagnose the 'Network Error' in the Conversations component. Found that the endpoint works correctly with valid lead IDs created through the add-lead endpoint, but fails with a 500 Internal Server Error when using invalid or non-existent lead IDs. The error in the logs shows: 'ValueError: [TypeError(\"'ObjectId' object is not iterable\"), TypeError('vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute')]'. This is likely causing the 'Network Error' in the frontend when clicking 'View Details' in the Conversations component. The issue is related to how MongoDB ObjectId is being handled in the response serialization. The fix would be to properly handle ObjectId serialization in the action_view_lead function and return a 404 status code for non-existent leads instead of a 500 error."
