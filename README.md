- Flexible configuration for temperature, presence penalty, and more

### 2. Multi-Agent Conversation System
- Specialized agents for different stages of the sales process:
  - Initial Contact Agent
  - Qualification Agent
  - Nurturing Agent
  - Objection Handler Agent
  - Closing Agent
  - Appointment Setting Agent
- Intelligent agent selection based on conversation context

### 3. Persistent Memory System
- Multi-layered memory architecture (factual, emotional, strategic, contextual)
- Cross-conversation context preservation
- Comprehensive lead profiles with AI-generated insights

### 4. Knowledge Base
- Document storage with vector embeddings
- Semantic search capabilities
- Training materials for AI agents

### 5. GHL Integration
- Seamless lead synchronization
- Custom field management
- Webhook processing

### 6. Voice & SMS Capabilities
- Vapi.ai integration for natural voice conversations
- SMS/MMS with intelligent multi-text cadence
